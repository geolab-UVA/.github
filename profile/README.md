# UVA Geometry Lab

The Geometry Lab @ UVA is an exploratory math workshop focused on geometry and hyperbolic geometry in particular.

We want to learn concepts from a more concrete, practical way. This means we will be exploring how exciting geomtries emerge not only as abstract mathematical constructions but in real life.
