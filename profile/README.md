# UVA Geometry Lab - FA22

The Geometry Lab @ UVA is an exploratory math workshop focused on geometry and hyperbolic geometry in particular.

We want to learn concepts from a more concrete, practical way. This means we will be exploring how exciting geomtries emerge not only as abstract mathematical constructions but in real life. 

## Meeting time
Common meeting time is usually on Tuesdays from 3:30pm to 5:30pm. We meet at the [STE(A)M Maker space (Chemistry 202)](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/space/maker-spaces)

Individual groups may meet at different times. During our common meetings we will periodically discuss the math behind non-Euclidean geometries and how they have appeared in our groups' investigations.

# Groups  - FA22

This semester we will mainly devide our exploration into 3 groups:

## Crochet

Visualizing hyperbolic space is difficult; for this we use models. But can we create a model in parctice. If you crochet in a specific pattern you can! Let us explore 
how and why.

## 3D printing

## Rendering visualizing geometries 

Many 3d rendering engines for games and animation are focused on our usual Euclidean reality. Can one use the tools available to help visualize non Euclidean geometries. We are out to understand how visualization and rendering works and how we can adapt it to more exciting and exotic settings.
