# UVA Geometry Lab

The Geometry Lab @ UVA is an exploratory math workshop focused on geometry and hyperbolic geometry in particular.

We want to learn concepts from a more concrete, practical way. This means we will be exploring how exciting geomtries emerge not only as abstract mathematical constructions but in real life. 

## Meeting time
Common meeting time is usually on Tuesdays from 3:30pm to 5:30pm. We meet at the [STE(A)M Maker space (Chemistry 202)](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/space/maker-spaces)

Individual groups may meet at different times. During our common meetings we will periodically discuss the math behind non-Euclidean geometries and how they have appeared in our groups' investigations.
